# M2O2P

This repository for SHOP4CF Component M2O2P which stands for  
Multi-Modal Online and Offline Programming Solutions  

M2O2P enables natural human inputs by reading sensor data from CaptoGlove LLC  
sensor glove, and changing the raw sensor data to states and so on to gestures.  
These gestures are used to make commands which are POSTed to FIWARE and  
published to ROS2 topics, and additionally using Integration-Service  
as a bridge to ROS1 topics.
